    <p class="section"> 
        In 1897, Dracula hired a lawyer, Jonathan Harker to travel to his Castle in Romania to go over the purchase of an Abbey in England. During Jonathan’s stay, Dracula was feeding on his blood to be younger, in the end Jonathan managed to escape to a convent, where he was questioned by a nun named Sister Agatha. Dracula appeared at the gates in the form of a wolf, Sister Agatha goaded him and cut her finger, and dropped blood at him, calling him a beast. Count Dracula questioned who she was and how she knew about him and his inability to set foot on property without permission. He got her name, Agatha Van Helsing, through her blood, "Blood is lives" is something he frequently says. This starts his fascination with Agatha because she knows about him and wishes to figure out why he is what he is.
